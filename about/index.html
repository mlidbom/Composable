<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">We believe that people should always be a vital consideration</dt>
<dd>
<p>We believe that our level of success of failure in collaborative endeavors hinges more on the humans, relationships and cultures involved than on any other factor. On how well we collaborate, communicate, motivate etc. We believe that this in turn hinges on our understanding of ourselves, on our understanding of human nature, on our understanding of the human mind and its properties, strengths and weaknesses. We believe that this understanding must include our drives, instincts, emotions and feelings. We believe that whenever we lose sight of this as a vital consideration when making choices we are likely to make choices with poor outcomes. This includes software design choices.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">We believe in the necessity of accepting complexity and letting go of certainty</dt>
<dd>
<p>We believe we all instinctively prefer simplicity, certainty and absolutes. That this is a trait that was likely adaptive when we lived as hunter gatherers. We believe that this is no longer a primarily adaptive trait. We believe that succumbing to this trait cripples our ability to see the true complexity of the reality we have before us. Rather than clear cut wrong and right ways to do things we believe that we face great complexity and a great amount of possible choices in every situation. We believe that we must accept the weight of the uncertainty of this reality in order to make good choices.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">We believe in the superiority of motivated belief over dichotomies and absolutes</dt>
<dd>
<p>We believe that succumbing to the desire to think and debate in terms of simple good versus bad dichotomies or absolutes such as "best way" is crippling. That it cripples not only our own understanding, but even more so our ability to collaborate in teams and larger communities. We believe that it is far better to say: "We believe" and then motivate that belief, than to state something as a fact without motivation. We believe that we must resist the temptation to talk about good versus bad and wrong versus right. We believe that there is no such thing as a "best" way to do anything, rather every option has a complex set of consequences in any specific set of circumstances which we never fully understand. We believe that we should abandon the false simplicity of right versus wrong dichotomies and absolutes such as "best".</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">We believe that development should focus on shared mental models designed for humans</dt>
<dd>
<p>We believe that developing software is first and foremost a process of collaboratively designing and communicating shared mental models.  We believe that our focus must be on the quality and clarity of our mental models and the clarity and expressiveness of the code that we use to communicate these mental models to each other and our future selves. That the quality of a design is determined by how easily the totality of the mental models that it contains can be learned, communicated, and modified by human beings.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">We believe that the primary limiting factor is the mental burden imposed by the totality of our shared mental models</dt>
<dd>
<p>We believe that in the majority of software development situations a lack of focus on the quality of the mental models is ultimately the primary factor limiting progress. That progress slows and ultimately stalls when the totality of our mental models fall into a state where the humans developing them can no longer effectively learn, understand, modify and communicate them. We believe that if we continually refactor our mental models to fit the human mind it is possible to maintain progress indefinitely without stalling and with limited slowdown even when facing immensely complicated software. We believe that this is the implicit principle underpinning approaches such as Domain Driven Design and principles such as SOLID.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">We require you to learn a "new" modelling paradigm, semantic events</dt>
<dd>
<p>We do not believe that we would be able to build highly complicated software using a language that did not support a flexible modelling paradigm, such as object oriented programming, without great loss of productivity, simplicity and safety. We believe that such standardized modelling paradigms enable us to successfully manage far greater levels of complexity than we could without them.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what we aim to achieve by ubiquitously leveraging the semantic event modeling paradigm throughout our tools. Using the existing interface support in C# we enable you to model a highly complicated domain in terms of which events can occur and how the meanings of these events relate to each other, the aggregate root to which they belong, and to other abstractions in the domain. The same modelling paradigm is utilized at all levels of design. From the smallest component or entity nested in an aggregate to designing and implementing the highest level integrations in an ecosystem of integrated systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our experience is that this new modelling paradigm, this new view of your domain and ecosystem of domains, is highly beneficial to managing and scaling complexity of the domains and integrations between them. We also find it highly beneficial in communicating with with domain experts. It has given us an expressive way of viewing a system in terms of what can happen, without getting bogged down in the details of how.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the technical side it enables us to dramatically cut down on manual code and manual configuration. It enables us to build complicated aggregates, read models, and message based integrations with simple, SOLID, expressive code. All with zero manual routing code or configuration to take into consideration. You can use the same powerful mental model to understand how everything will work at all levels instead of having to design and remember countless custom routes within aggregates and within the bus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our experience is that this as a whole dramatically reduces the total mental burden of understanding a large system or ecosystem of systems. Our experience is that it allows us to scale to far greater complexity of a domain and exposed features without development slowing or virtually stalling due to the runaway mental burden of an implementation that does not leverage a powerful modelling paradigm.</p>

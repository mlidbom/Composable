== Messaging
Any method call can, if you squint, be viewed as one object sending a message to another object.
However, this ties the sender to the receiver in a very tight way.
Great benefits can be had by making the message passing explicit.
By sending messages to a receiver through some intermediary rather than directly.
Doing so is called messaging.

TIP: Messaging is also known as message passing.

NOTE: The code blocks in this section contain pseudo code for illustration purposes.
It is not compatible with any specific library including Composable.

=== Messaging terms
Here we define some terms as they are used in the context of this document.

Message::
An object for the purpose of sending data to a receiver.

Message Type::
The System.Type returned by `message.GetType()`.

Message Handler::
In principle just a function that takes a message as a parameter.
+
[source,csharp]
----
void Handle(RegisterAccountCommand command)
----
+
In practice most message handlers need to have one or more dependencies injected into them.
In order to support this handlers are often required to be wrapped inside interfaces.
 That way instances of implementing classes can be resolved from an IOC container easily.
+
[source,csharp]
----
interface IMessageHandler<RegisterAccountCommand>
{
    void Handle(RegisterAccountCommand aMessage);
}
----

Routing::
The mechanism by which messages are delivered to handlers.

Service Bus::
A component which decouples message senders from message handlers.
Instead of client code calling handler methods, clients send and receive messages via the bus.
The bus is responsible for routing the messages to the appropriate handler(s) and invoking them.
+
[source]
.Manual service invokation requires an instance of the service.
----
serviceInstance.RegisterAccount(arguments....
----
+
[source,csharp]
.Client don't even know where the service is when accessing it across a bus
----
bus.Execute(new RegisterAccountCommand(
----
+
TIP: The benefits of this decoupling may not be obvious at first, but they are profound.

Command::
A message that instructs the handler to perform an action.
+
[source,csharp]
----
class RegisterAccountCommand
{
    Password Password { get; }
    Email Email { set; }
}
----

Event::
A message that informs handlers about something that has happened.
+
[source,csharp]
----
interface IAccountRegisteredEvent
{
    Password Password { get; }
    Email Email { get; }
}
----

Query::
A message that asks the handler to supply some data.
+
[source,csharp]
----
class RecentlyRegisteredAccountsQuery
{
    TimeSpan MaxAge { get; }
}
----

Command Handler::
A message handler for a command. Must ensure that the command is successfully executed or throw an exception.

Query Handler::
A message handler for a query. Must ensure that the query is successfully executed or throw an exception.

Event Handler::
A message handler for an event.

Event Listener::
Same as Event Handler.

Subscribe::
The action of registering an Event Handler with a service bus.

Subscriber::
An event handler registered on a service bus.

Sending a command or query::
Asking a service bus to deliver a message to its handler.

Publishing an event::
Sending an event to all it's subscribers.

Raising an event::
Same as Publishing an event

WARNING: You should never talk about sending events.
You always publish/Raise events.
Keeping Send separate from Publish in your mind is fundamental to understanding.
Trust us on this.


=== Semantic Routing
Powerful, zero configuration, message type base routing.
Extremely loose coupling between event publishers and handlers.

==== Definition
* Messages are delivered to every registered handler with a compatible argument type.
* Commands and query message types must have exactly one handler.

TIP: Note that the first rule is really just standard polymorphism.

TIP: Semantic Routing is also known as "Polymorphic routing" or "Polymorphic  dispatching".

==== Clarifying examples
While the rules might be simple their consequences can be anything but.
Let's try some basic examples.

[source,csharp]
.Given these event interfaces and implementing classes
----
interface IA
interface IB : IA
interface IC : IB

class A : IA {}
class B : IB {}
class C : IC {}
----

[source,csharp]
.And these handler methods registered on our service bus
----
void HandleA(IAEvent //Handles IA, IB and IC
void HandleB(IBEvent //Handles IB and IC
void HandleC(IBEvent //Handles only IC
----

[source,csharp]
.Let's publish some events and examine the results.
----
serviceBus.Publish(new A()); //Delivered to HandleA
serviceBus.Publish(new B()); //Delivered to HandleA and HandleB
serviceBus.Publish(new C()); //Delivered to HandleA, HandleB and HandleC
----

==== Loose coupling through interfaces
Working with events in terms of interfaces give a great mount of flexibility.
Here is a partial list of things it is possible to do without having to change any code in any event listener.

* Refactoring event classes
* Adding event classes
* Adding event interfaces
* Changing event inheritance hierarchy

TIP: The benefits of this are hard to overstate.
Make sure to remember to always think about events in terms of interfaces.
The event classes are an implementation detail that should only ever be known by the code that publishes the event.

WARNING: *Never subscribe to an event class*. You will lose all the benefits just discussed.

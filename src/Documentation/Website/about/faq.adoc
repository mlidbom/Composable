Should I use Composable?::
We believe that this question is one that only you can answer and that you need to understand what you can expect from Composable now and in the future to answer it. We would suggest you start by reading about how our CoreBeliefs lead to our DesignPrinciples  and which PrimaryArchitecturalChoices this has lead us to. If the reasoning in these documents mostly fit your thinking you can continue by starting to read the Documentation. If reading all of this sounds like an unreasonable amount of work to you we suspect that Composable is not for you. Composable does have a quite steep learning curve in order to use it to full effect. If this is not acceptable to you you should probably look elsewhere.

Why do you enforce transactions for all update?::
Please read CoreBeliefs and DesignPrinciples

Isn't exactly once delivery impossible?::
No. All "arguments" to that effect that we have encountered "reason" by disallowing transactions and/or message deduplication. Only through imposing this artificial constraint does exactly once delivery become "impossible". Exactly once  == at least once + deduplication + transactions.
